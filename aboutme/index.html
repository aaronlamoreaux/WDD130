        <h2>Aaron Lamoreaux</h2>
        <p>I am currently going for a bachelor's degree in applied technology at BYU Idaho. I've been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints since I was 8 years old. </p> 
        <p>My favorite scripture would be nephi 3:7.</p>
        <p>"And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto my father: I will go and do</p>
        <P>the things which the lord hath commanded, for I know the lord gives no commandment</P>
        <p>unto the children of men, save he prepares away for them that they might</p>
        <p>accomplish the thing which he commandeth them."</p>
